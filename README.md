# JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator

**Description:  A password generates according to the user's selection.** 

When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button they receive the first prompt asking for the password length they desire.  This generator can create a password from 8 to 128 characters.
If a prompt is received outside that range the user will receive a message to try again.

Next, a series of confirmation will complete the generation of the password.  You simply click OK if you would like special characters, numbers, upper, and/ or lower case.
Simularly to the previous prompts, one of the charater type prompts must be selected to continue.

After all prompts are met, a password is generated in the box where the user can copy and paste it anywhere they would need the password.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
